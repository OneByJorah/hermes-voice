## Detailed Findings

### 1. Lint & Formatting

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| flake8 config | ✅ PASS | `.flake8` present with max-line-length=100, sensible ignores |
| ruff auto-fixes | ✅ PASS | Applied in commit `f392d81` |

**Score: 95/100**

### 2. Dead Code

| Finding | Severity | Details |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Dependabot tracks npm ecosystem | DEGRADED | `dependabot.yml` configures `npm` ecosystem but there are zero JS/TS source files in the repo. This is a template vestige. |

**Score: 70/100**

### 3. Dependency Review

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|

**Score: 80/100**

### 5. Secrets

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|

| No hardcoded secrets in code | ✅ PASS | API_KEY defaults to empty string |
| Audit commit sanitized emails | ✅ PASS | Commit `6433101` sanitized email references |
| Default credentials in server_asterisk.py | DEGRADED | `ARI_PASS = "changeme"` hardcoded default — documented but still a risk |

**Score: 75/100**

### 6. README Compliance

| Roadmap | ✅ PASS | Present with checkboxes |
| License | ✅ PASS | MIT |
| README architecture tree directory name mismatch | INFO | Tree shows `freeswitch/conf/dialplan/` — matches actual structure |
| README port cross-reference | INFO | BOT_WS_PORT=8765 matches code default |

**Score: 90/100**

### 7. Tests

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Test directory exists | ❌ FAIL | No `tests/` directory |
| Test files exist | ❌ FAIL | No test files anywhere in repo |

| Non-root user in Dockerfile | ❌ FAIL | Dockerfile runs as root (no USER directive) |
| .dockerignore | ❌ FAIL | No `.dockerignore` file |
| Host networking mode | INFO | Both services use `network_mode: host` — simplest for SIP/RTP but sacrifices isolation |

**Score: 50/100 — CRITICAL**

### 9. Folder Structure

| Check | Status | Details |

## Summary

**Production Score: 72/100 — DEGRADED**

The repository is well-structured with good documentation, CI/CD, and community standards. The critical gaps are:
1. **No tests** (0/100) — the single largest score drag
2. **No Docker health checks** — production reliability concern
3. **Dockerfile runs as root** — security concern

The DEGRADED items are mostly template vestiges (npm Dependabot, JS/TS in CodeQL) and minor improvements.
